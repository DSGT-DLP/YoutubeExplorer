# Written Component

Answer the following questions in your own words. 3-4 sentences max. Don't just copy/paste what you see in the documentation. You want to be able to explain the concept to someone who is unfamiliar with the topic.

## Conceptual
1. What is a component in React.js?

2. What is the difference between a state vs. a prop in React?


## Reflection
3. How would you handle a scenario where a user enters a Youtube Channel in your app that doesn't actually exist? What fixes would you make to the code? 

4. Besides the technical concepts, what were some learnings you gained from this project? Any suggestions you have to make this project a better learning experience for others? (you can share and are encouraged to share these suggestions in the discussion forum on the Github repo as long as you don't spoil the solution to the project)
