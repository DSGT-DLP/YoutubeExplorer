# Youtube Explorer App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this project for?
For those who intend to join the Deep Learning Playground project but want to learn about APIs and React.js in simpler environment, this project will help you to build the basic foundations of React.js plus how to work with backend APIs to build all sorts of applications. 

## How do I see something on the browser?
At the root of the project (ie: at the `~/YoutubeExplorer` path), run `npm run build` to build the app and add the necessary dependencies. Then run `npm start`. You should be able to see a `localhost:3000` server spin up and you will see your content rendered in the browser. 

## What is the goal of this application?
We want to build a platform where you can enter the name of a Youtube Channel and answer some basic questions.
